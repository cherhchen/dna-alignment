# Global and Local Alignment Algorithms with User Interface

Through this project, I implemented the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment and Smith-Waterman algorithm for local alignment. To facilitate ease of use and efficiency, I also created a user interface for computing both global and local alignment algorithms using React, HTML, and CSS for the frontend and JavaScript for the backend.

**The code for the alignment algorithms is located in [src/alignment.js](https://github.com/cherhchen/dna-alignment/blob/main/src/alignment.js).**
